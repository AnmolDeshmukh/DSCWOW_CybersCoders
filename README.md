MYSURU_TOURISM_TRACK
For the solution, we have made a webiste for Mysuru tourism. We have made this website using WordPress.
We have added many features in our website like map, photos, a short video of the city, recommended places, place to find a volunteer and a chat bot.

We used WordPress because it is open source, free and easy to use.
It is very customizable and video and photo management becomes very easy.
